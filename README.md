# n8n-flow-manager 🚀

**n8n-flow-manager** is a robust, production-ready Python SDK and CLI for the [n8n automation platform](https://n8n.io/). Unlike simple HTTP wrappers, this package is designed for **DevOps workflows**, providing type-safe models, async operations, workflow templating, and CI/CD integration capabilities.

## 🚀 Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher
- n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted)

### Global CLI Installation (Recommended)

Install globally using **pipx** (the best practice for Python CLI tools):

```bash
# Install pipx if you don't have it
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath

# Install n8n-flow-manager globally
pipx install n8n-flow-manager

# Verify installation
n8n-py --version
n8n-py --help
```

> **Note:** If you don't have pipx, you can also use `pip install --user n8n-flow-manager`, but pipx is recommended as it isolates the package in its own environment.

### Configuration

After installation, configure your n8n credentials using environment variables:

```bash
# Set your n8n credentials
export N8N_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
export N8N_BASE_URL="https://your-instance.n8n.cloud"

# Test the connection
n8n-py health
```

**Optional:** To make credentials persistent, add them to your shell profile:

```bash
# For zsh (macOS default)
echo 'export N8N_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export N8N_BASE_URL="https://your-instance.n8n.cloud"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# For bash
echo 'export N8N_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export N8N_BASE_URL="https://your-instance.n8n.cloud"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Getting Your API Key

1. Open your n8n instance
2. Go to **Settings** → **API**
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Copy the key and use it in the configuration above

**That's it!** You're ready to use n8n-flow-manager 🎉

### For Developers

If you want to use n8n-flow-manager as a Python library in your projects:

```bash
# Install with pip
pip install n8n-flow-manager

# Use in your code
from n8n_manager import N8NClient
```

For contributing or development, see the [Development](#-development) section below.

## 🛠️ Usage Guide

### 1. Python SDK Usage

#### Basic Client Usage

```python
import asyncio
from n8n_manager import N8NClient

async def main():
    # Initialize client (reads from environment)
    async with N8NClient() as client:

        # List all active workflows
        workflows = await client.workflows.list(active=True)
        for wf in workflows:
            print(f"Workflow: {wf.name} (ID: {wf.id})")

        # Get specific workflow
        workflow = await client.workflows.get("workflow_id")
        print(f"Nodes: {len(workflow.nodes)}")

        # Execute workflow and wait for result
        execution = await client.executions.run_and_wait(
            workflow_id="workflow_id",
            timeout=60
        )
        print(f"Status: {execution.status}")
        print(f"Success: {execution.is_successful}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

#### Creating Workflows Programmatically

```python
from n8n_manager import N8NClient
from n8n_manager.models.workflow import Workflow, Node

async def create_simple_workflow():
    async with N8NClient() as client:
        workflow = Workflow(
            name="Python-Created Workflow",
            active=False,
            nodes=[
                Node(
                    name="Start",
                    type="n8n-nodes-base.start",
                    position=[250, 300],
                    parameters={}
                ),
                Node(
                    name="Set Data",
                    type="n8n-nodes-base.set",
                    position=[450, 300],
                    parameters={
                        "values": {
                            "string": [
                                {"name": "message", "value": "Hello from Python!"}
                            ]
                        }
                    }
                )
            ],
            connections={
                "Start": {
                    "main": [[{"node": "Set Data", "type": "main", "index": 0}]]
                }
            }
        )

        created = await client.workflows.create(workflow)
        print(f"Created workflow: {created.id}")
```

#### Using Templates

```python
from n8n_manager.utils.templating import load_workflow_from_file

# Load workflow with template variables
workflow = load_workflow_from_file(
    "templates/data_sync.json",
    variables={
        "environment": "production",
        "api_endpoint": "https://api.example.com",
        "timeout": 30
    }
)

async with N8NClient() as client:
    deployed = await client.workflows.create(workflow)
    print(f"Deployed: {deployed.name}")
```

### 2. CLI Usage

The CLI provides powerful commands for workflow management.

**Example Output:**

```bash
$ n8n-py health
✓ Connection healthy!
  API URL: https://n8n.example.com/

$ n8n-py list-workflows
                              Workflows (33 found)
┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━┓
┃ ID               ┃ Name                           ┃ Active ┃ Nodes ┃
┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━┩
│ 1RDHBsmLkkTptybX │ Production Data Sync           │ ✓      │ 6     │
│ 2V3iCBkiOAPVzrUr │ Customer Onboarding            │ ✗      │ 7     │
│ 8qGqx5TW1QA7T8P9 │ Error Notifications            │ ✓      │ 2     │
└──────────────────┴────────────────────────────────┴────────┴───────┘
```

#### Commands

```bash
# List all workflows
n8n-py list-workflows

# List only active workflows
n8n-py list-workflows --active
```

#### Get Workflow Details

```bash
# Display workflow info
n8n-py get-workflow <workflow_id>

# Save workflow to file
n8n-py get-workflow <workflow_id> --output workflow.json
```

#### Deploy Workflows

```bash
# Deploy from JSON file
n8n-py deploy workflow.json

# Deploy with template variables
n8n-py deploy template.json --var environment=prod --var timeout=30

# Deploy and activate immediately
n8n-py deploy workflow.json --activate
```

#### Update an Existing Workflow (push)

```bash
# Pull a workflow to a file
n8n-py get-workflow <workflow_id> --output workflow.json

# ... edit the file, commit it to Git ...

# Push it back, overwriting the SAME workflow (ID is read from the file)
n8n-py push workflow.json

# Or target an explicit ID
n8n-py push workflow.json --id <workflow_id>
```

> `deploy` always **creates** a new workflow. `push` **updates** an existing one.
> Use `push` for a pull → edit → push cycle with version control.
>
> Archived workflows cannot be updated (n8n restriction). `push` detects this and
> tells you to unarchive first. `list-workflows` shows an **Archived** column.

#### Backup Workflows

```bash
# Backup all workflows
n8n-py backup --output ./backups

# Backup only active workflows
n8n-py backup --output ./backups --active-only
```

#### Execute Workflows

```bash
# Execute and wait for completion
n8n-py execute <workflow_id>

# Execute without waiting
n8n-py execute <workflow_id> --no-wait

# Execute with input data
n8n-py execute <workflow_id> --input data.json
```

#### Activate/Deactivate

```bash
# Activate workflow
n8n-py activate <workflow_id>

# Deactivate workflow
n8n-py deactivate <workflow_id>
```

#### Configure Credentials

```bash
# Interactive setup: prompts for the API key (hidden), writes to
# your shell config and/or a local .env, and tests the connection
n8n-py config

# Only create a .env file in the current directory
n8n-py config --local-only
```

#### Delete a Workflow

```bash
# Asks for confirmation, showing name and node count first
n8n-py delete <workflow_id>

# Skip the prompt (CI)
n8n-py delete <workflow_id> --yes
```

> Deletion cannot be undone. Back the workflow up first with
> `get-workflow --output` or `backup`.

#### Health Check

```bash
# Verify connection to n8n
n8n-py health
```

            workflow_id=workflow_id,
            limit=50
        )

        for execution in executions:
            if execution.is_failed:
